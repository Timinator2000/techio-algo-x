# Overview

Mahjong is a strategic tile-based game that originated in China, played with 144 tiles featuring Chinese characters and symbols. It requires skill, memory, and calculation as players form specific tile combinations to win.

In this puzzle, @Unihedron presents three winning configurations. Your task is to determine whether your hand, plus a newly drawn tile, forms a valid winning combination. While two configurations are relatively simple to check, the third poses a greater challengeâ€”one that may benefit from a well-designed algorithm to simplify implementation. ðŸ˜‰

Labeled as "very hard," this puzzle might seem daunting at first. However, the skills you have honed in this playground should make solving it far more approachable than it appears.
