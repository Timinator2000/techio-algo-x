Donald Knuth covers Algorithm X and Dancing Links in _The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4B Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 2_. The PDF I purchased from {{ link needed }} is __734 pages__! In November, 2000, Knuth published a 26 page PDF titled _Dancing Links_ on [arXiv.org]() where it can be downloaded for free.

Knuth’s short paper is a great read. Not only does he cover Dancing Links in detail, he provides some interesting history of exact cover research and some powerful combinatoric data. Most importantly (for this page of this playground anyway), he provides significant detail on applying Algorithm X to Pentominoes, a subset of Polyominoes where every puzzle piece is made up of exactly 5 squares. Knuth’s Pentominoes explanation should provide more than enough guidance for you to finish this puzzle.
