# Strategy

Even in a world overrun by the undead, there’s still room for small moments of warmth —  quiet laughter over a meager meal, the comforting weight of a weapon held steady, the unspoken promise between survivors. In the midst of chaos, resilience isn’t just about fighting to stay alive, but finding reasons to keep going.

This puzzle will test your resilience! Before jumping into the code, I highly recommend playing the online version, [Undead from Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/undead.html).
