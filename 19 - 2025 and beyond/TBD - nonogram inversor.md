__Algorithm X Complexity:__ Quite Challenging

# Spoiler Alert

Here I go again with the preemptive spoiler alert. This puzzle might be easier to solve with logic than it is to solve with Algorithm X. However, the Algorithm X solution is wonderfully satisfying if you choose to down that fairly challenging path.

# What I (and others) Tried

From the problem statement:

>In this version, we have only two colors, black and white.
>You will be given the length of all black groups.

For each row and each column, we are given the lengths of each _group_ of contiguous black cells in that row or column. Each group of contiguous black cells must be separated by 1 or more white cells. Because there is no difference between a row of cells and column of cells, I will use the word _line_ to generically refer to either a row or column. Each line has some number of cells and zero or more groups of contiguous black cells. 

Consider a 5 x 5 Nonogram. My initial thought was to have a 5 x 5 gameboard and then determine all possible layouts for each line. All lines must be covered by a layout. Because horizontal lines and vertical lines will intersect, I considered using coloring or significant numbers of `me_requirements` to ensure incompatible lines were not placed in the same solution.

Using this approach, I was able to solve __Test Cases 1 and 2__, but I timed out on the remaining test cases. There can be many possible layouts for a line that has multiple groups and there can be many combinations of horizontal and vertical lines that are incompatible. I needed my solution to be significantly faster, so I turned to problem-space reduction.

Once you go down the road of problem-space reduction on this puzzle, it doesnâ€™t take long to find solutions strictly using logic. With a solution in hand, you might wonder why anyone would continue banging his or her head against the wall looking for the Algorithm X solution. Maybe you just enjoy the challenge, or maybe you really like headaches. Either way, __on the next page, I will go through how I built an Algorithm X solution to this puzzle.__
