# Overview

This puzzle, crafted by @Harry.B., is a stellar, visual exact-cover problem using the [CodinGame Game Engine SDK](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/25775/codingame-sdk-documentation/introduction). It earns two thumbs up for its engaging design! To succeed, you’ll need sharp grid-navigation skills to generate possible paths between pairs of same-colored endpoints. Once you’ve mastered path generation, Algorithm X will efficiently find solutions for all test cases.

Keep your code tight as things will get a lot tougher in Part 2!
