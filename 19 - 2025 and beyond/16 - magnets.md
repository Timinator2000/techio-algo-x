# Strategy

@VizGharâ€™s **Magnets** puzzle is a **polarizing** test of logic, where every decision attracts or repels another. You must fill the grid with polarized magnets and neutral wooden blocks. To keep the grid *stable*, no two orthogonal cells can share the same polarity â€” no two `+` cells or two `â€“` cells may touch. Each row and column must also satisfy its given counts of positive and negative poles.

A basic **Algorithm X** setup will get you most of the way there, but the toughest test cases require a bit of extra optimization â€” something you can approach in several ways. As you might expect by now, I chose a round of logical **problem-space reduction** that trimmed the hardest grids down to smaller, solvable cores that Algorithm X could finish effortlessly.

This puzzle is based on [**Magnets**](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/magnets.html) from Simon Tathamâ€™s *Portable Puzzle Collection*. Logical deduction feels a bit more elusive here than in many other puzzles, but playing a few rounds by hand is a great way to uncover useful strategies and develop a stronger intuition for the puzzleâ€™s magnetic dynamics.
