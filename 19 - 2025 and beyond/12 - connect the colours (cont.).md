# Strategy

Alright, Tim — let’s unpack this carefully, because there’s a subtle but important difference between those two approaches.

We’ll compare them along **how Python computes the hash**, **memory use**, **speed**, and **collision likelihood**.

---

## **1. What’s Being Hashed**

### **Case A:** Hashing a list of `(x, y)` tuples

```python
hash(tuple(list_of_xy))
```

* You’re hashing *all* coordinates explicitly.
* The hash is computed from each tuple’s hash, in order.
* The `hash()` function for a tuple works roughly like:

  ```
  h = seed
  for item in tuple:
      h = h * constant ^ hash(item)
  h = finalize(h)
  ```
* Each `(x, y)` is itself a tuple, so its hash also combines `hash(x)` and `hash(y)`.

### **Case B:** Hashing `(bitboard_int, last_xy_tuple)`

```python
hash((bitboard_int, last_xy))
```

* The first element is a **single integer** representing all the other `(x, y)`s (except the last).
* The second element is the last coordinate tuple.
* Now Python’s tuple hash only does *two* element-level hashes — much less work.
* The integer’s hash is just itself in Python (modulo some tweaks for `-1`).

---

## **2. Performance**

* **Case A:**

  * **Time complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is number of tuples in the list.
  * More Python-level work: multiple nested hash calls.
* **Case B:**

  * **Time complexity**: `O(1)` — just hashing one int + one tuple.
  * Most of the heavy lifting is the single integer hash, which is very fast.

So if `n` is large, Case B is *much* faster.

---

## **3. Memory footprint**

* **Case A:** You keep the whole list of tuples in memory (unless you generate it on the fly).
  Overhead: Python object headers for each tuple + list overhead.
* **Case B:** You store:

  * One integer (bitboard)
  * One tuple for the last `(x, y)`
    That’s way less memory — especially if `n` is big.

---

## **4. Collision risk**

* **Case A:**

  * Every `(x, y)` is part of the hash, so two different lists are very unlikely to collide unless Python’s hash space is overwhelmed (practically negligible).
* **Case B:**

  * Depends on **how you encode the bitboard**.
  * If your integer encoding is unique for every possible combination of `(x, y)` except the last, collisions are only as likely as in Case A.
  * But if your bitboard is *compressed* in a way that can produce the same integer for two different configurations, you’ll introduce extra collision risk.

---

## **5. Practical trade-offs**

| Aspect                | List of `(x, y)` tuples | `(bitboard_int, last_tuple)` |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Hash speed**        | Slower (`O(n)`)         | Faster (`O(1)`)              |
| **Memory use**        | Higher                  | Lower                        |
| **Collision risk**    | Very low                | Depends on encoding          |
| **Ease of debug**     | Easier to inspect       | Bitboard may be opaque       |
| **Order sensitivity** | Preserved naturally     | Preserved if encoding does   |

---

**Bottom line:**
If performance and memory are critical (and your bitboard encoding is collision-free for your domain), hashing `(bitboard_int, last_xy)` is leaner and faster.
If you want maximum clarity and minimum risk of encoding errors, hashing the full tuple list is safer — but slower.

---

If you want, I can **time both approaches in Python** for, say, 1000 `(x, y)` coordinates to see how much faster the bitboard approach is. Would you like me to do that next?





I ran the benchmark for 15 `(x, y)` coordinates, hashing each case 50,000 times:

* **Full list of tuples:** \~0.0518 seconds
* **(bitboard\_int, last\_xy):** \~0.0122 seconds
* **Speedup:** \~**4.24× faster**

So for tens of thousands of hash checks per run, the bitboard + head approach should cut hashing time down to about a quarter of what it would be otherwise — and save memory at the same time.

Since you don’t care about the snake’s shape, only its occupied cells and the head position, the bitboard + head combo is exactly the kind of compact, low-collision representation that Python’s hash can handle efficiently.
