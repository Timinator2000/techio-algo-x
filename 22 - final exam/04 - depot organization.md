# Overview

This puzzle has only 7 tiles that need to be arranged on 7 locations on the gameboard. At this point in your journey, that description should set off your exact cover alarm bells! This couldn’t be more straightforward, could it? Conceptually, that is true, but a couple of quirks make this puzzle a very enjoyable challenge.

Working with hexagons brings a little complexity to this otherwise reasonable puzzle. For more practice with hexagons, check out the following (not exact cover) challenges on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/home):
