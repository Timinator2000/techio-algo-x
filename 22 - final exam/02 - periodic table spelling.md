__Algorithm X Complexity:__ A Benchmarking Opportunity

# Overview

It is not often an opportunity comes along to test your skills on an exact-cover puzzle classified as “easy”. If you have completed a reasonable portion of this playground, you should be able to fly through this puzzle. I suggest you take this opportunity to test your knowledge and benchmark your learning. Use the following questions to reflect on your results:

* How much of your `AlgorithmXSolver` subclass were you able to write from memory?
* How many syntax errors did you need to correct?
* Did you make errors setting up your requirements and actions?
* How long did it take before you had a full solution?

In my introduction to this playground, I made a handful of promises, including:

>* You will become proficient with a powerful and repeatable problem-solving technique known as Algorithm X.
>* You will experience the compelling nature of reusable software architectures.
>* You will find [puzzles] significantly easier than [they] would have been otherwise.
>* You will have a lot of fun.

My hope is that this benchmarking exercise demonstrates why I made those promises.
