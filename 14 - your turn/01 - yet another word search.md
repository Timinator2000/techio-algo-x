# Strategy

The information covered on the previous two pages should make this puzzle fairly straightforward. You need to find hidden words in a word search puzzle. The only catch is that some, or maybe manyüòÄ, of the letters are illegible. Considering what has already been covered, there isn't too much more I can say without completely giving the solution away.

I feel bad about this. I don't like the idea of just giving the solution away.

Thinking of this puzzle as a word search is a painful road to travel. Instead, think of this puzzle as a word search construction puzzle. Given a list of words and a partially filled-in grid, you must construct a word search that fits within the parameters defined by the prefilled cells. In this puzzle, you must create a solution for the word search construction example Knuth uses in his book to discuss the topic of ‚Äúcoloring‚Äù. The coloring discussion in the previous section should be enough to guide you to a solution!
