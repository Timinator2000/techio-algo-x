# Ruby

Ruby is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language known for its readability and ease of use. Ruby shares many similarities with Python, such as automatic memory management and object-oriented principles. @Rafarafa has attempted a word for word translation, even preserving the comments found in my Python code. Using the Ruby solver below is extremely similar to the Python examples provided in the playground.

# Key Difference

My Python [`AlgorithmXSolver`](the-algorithmxsolver) makes extensive use of tuples. Because Ruby does not have tuples, you will use arrays for requirements and actions. These arrays will be used as keys in a `hash`, so take appropriate care to ensure the array elements never change. 


# Example - Sudoku

```
class SudokuSolver < AlgorithmXSolver
  
  def initialize(grid, values)

    # Build requirements and actions.
    
    super(requirements, actions)
  end
end

n = 9
grid = n.times.map { gets.chomp.split("") }
solver = SudokuSolver.new(grid, [*"1"..n.to_s].take(n).join)
solution = solver.solve.take(1).first

solution.each do | _, row, col, val|
  grid[row][col] = val
end
```
