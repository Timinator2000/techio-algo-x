# Solver Translations

On the following pages are various language translations of the provided [`AlgorithmXSolver`](the-algorithmxsolver). I am not the author of any of these translations. CodinGamers with significantly more language expertise than me have taken on the task of writing these translations and sharing their code. I owe each of them a debt of gratitude.

# Quality Guarantee

For each translation, either the author or I have completed several puzzles using the translation and feel confident in the functionality. I spent two years working with and refining my Python solver. Obviously, we canâ€™t do that with each translation. However, I will make this pseudo guarantee:

_If you run into any issues with any of these translations, post a note in the [CodinGame Forum]( https://www.codingame.com/forum) and I feel very confident the CodinGame community will make sure you get the help you need._
